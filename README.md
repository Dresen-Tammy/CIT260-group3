Oregon Trail Java console game. 
Our version of the iconic game of pioneers heading west takes you from Missouri to Oregon with 30 stops along the way.  You must cross rivers, barter and hunt for food and supplies, and get wisdom from talking to the locals in order to complete a successful journey. 
This was a group project.
